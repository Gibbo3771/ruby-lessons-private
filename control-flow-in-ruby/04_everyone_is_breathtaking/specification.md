# Everyone is breathtaking specification

Continuing off from our last exercise, lets improve our program to use what we have learned so far.

We are going to take our breathtaking app and add some new functionality. We need to handle situations when the user does not enter anything. We want the program to fail _gracefuly_.

What the program should do:

- Ask the user for their name
- Call them by name and tell them that they are breathtaking
- If the user does not enter a name, we should instead shout "I didn't hear your name! You are all breathtaking!"

Extras:

- Use a ternary operator rather than an `if` statement
